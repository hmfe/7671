I tested app with opera, chrome, edge and run it through google eslint.
I used wiktionary for API

Small things can be improved for production (popup notifications for add/delete, error handling, better structured layout (fixed paddings and elements sizes, margins, etc., block namings...)
Also, more test should be written for production, mock api call, tests for redux, components, etc.

## npm i    
to install dependencies    

## npm run start
to run application    

## npm run test    
to run tests
